# Salifort Motors Workforce Turnover Analysis

### Background of the Salifort Motors Scenario

#### About the company

Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.

As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, you have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with analyzing the data to develop ideas for increasing employee retention. To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful.

### Project Overview

This project aimed to create a predictive model through multiple logistic regression or machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, or eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). This project utilized employee statistics recorded by Salifort Motors and is the capstone project for Google's Advance Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The champion model for this analysis was a random forest with tuned hyper-parameters. The following metrics were used to evaluate the algorithm's success.

| Model Name	| F1 Score | Precision |	Recall | Accuracy | AUC |
| ----------  | -------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
|Tuned Random Forest|	88.67%	| 87.04% |	90.36%	| 96.16% | 93.84% |

The random forest model determined the most relevant features for separating employees who are likely to leave from those who won't are last_evaluation, number_project, tenure, and overworked. We note that the latter feature was engineered and represents the employees who worked over 175 hours in a month or not.

### Business Understanding

During the Exploratory Data Analysis process, we observed that salary and department are not leading factors for employee turnover rates. We see that the number of projects, hours worked, tenure and recent evaluation scores are good indicators of employee turnover. Another important aspect of this project was to determine the best way to invest in employee training and resources without losing skilled workers. Thus, our recommendations would be to have better allocations of projects and improve processes to reward long-tenured and overworked employees.

### Data Understanding

The dataset was artificially generated by Google for this project. The fictional company's data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv) and is free to use according to this [license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). The data consisted of approximately 12k unique employees and 10 features per employee. The features included employee satisfaction, evaluation score, number of projects contributed to, the average number of hours worked per month, tenure, whether if they had a work accident if they were promoted within the last 5 years, the department worked for, and salary. The bar chart below shows the proportion of employee leaving Salifort Motors

### Modeling and Evaluation

An XGBoost model with tuned hyperparameters and feature engineering was used to determine feature importance in who would leave or stay at Salifort Motors. The below plot shows that the number of contributing projects, tenure with company, last evaluation score, working an average of over 175 hours per month, experiencing an accident, and salary are important factors.

### Conclusion

The XGBoost model that was developed can benefit Salifort Motors in knowing if an employee is leaving or not. Dedicating resources into the feature importance will limit employee turnover while promoting good work culture.
